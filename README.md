# Tic-Tac-Toe

  This is a solution to play Tic-Tac-Toe game in ruby via terminal, it is a OOP solution

# How to Play

  Simply use this command at your terminal:
  ```
  $ ruby lib/game.rb
  ```

  You need to select between X or O, X play first, after the game is finished you can choose (1) to play again
  and 2 to end the application

# Classes

  We had only 2 classes, one is for the player which contains the player marker (X or O), and a few validations.
  And the other class is the TicTacBoard which can be able to verify everything, who is the next player, who won and more, and its also able to draw the actually board.
